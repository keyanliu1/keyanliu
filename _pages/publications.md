- **Paper Title:** Non-Gaussian Structural Vector Autoregression with Unknown Break Points (Job market paper)
  
  **Abstract:* In this paper, I consider testing and estimating non-Gaussian Structural Vector Autoregressive models with unknown break points (SVAR-BP). This model extends traditional SVAR analysis by allowing for unknown breakpoints, capturing potential changes in both autoregressive coefficients and structural parameters. I employ the Partial Sample Generalized Method of Moments (PSGMM) to estimate the model and utilize the sup-Wald test to assess parameter stability. Additionally, I establish the asymptotic properties of the break point estimators and propose a sequential procedure for detecting and estimating multiple break points. My method is applied to a U.S. macroeconomic dataset from 1954 to 2023, where I identify significant structural breaks corresponding to key economic events. The results demonstrate the ability of our approach to detect and estimate multiple break points, modeling shifts in the dynamics of economic variables driven by external shocks.

- **Abstract:* We show that all shocks in an $n$-dimensional structural vector autoregression (SVAR) are globally identified up to their order and signs if they are orthogonal and either (i) have zero co-skewness and at most one of them is not skewed or (ii) exhibit no excess co-kurtosis and at least $n-1$ of them are leptokurtic. The former case covers SVAR models with errors following dependent volatility processes. Moreover, if the numbers of both skewed and leptokurtic shocks are smaller than $n-1$, the skewed and leptokurtic shocks are globally identified, while the remaining shocks are set identified. To capture the non-Gaussian features of the data, versatile error distributions are needed. We discuss the Bayesian implementation of an SVAR-GARCH model with skewed \textit{t}-distributed errors, including the assessment of the strength of identification and checking the validity of exogenous instruments potentially used for identification. The methods are illustrated in an empirical application to the oil market.

- **Paper Title:** Identifying Structural Vector Autoregression via Leptokurtic Economic Shocks  (with Markku Lanne and Jani Luoto)
  **Journal:** Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics
  **Publication Date:** August 2023  
  **Abstract:* This paper develops a novel approach for identifying structural shocks in Vector Autoregressions (VARs) using the leptokurtic nature of economic shocks. The method exploits higher moments of the data to recover structural shocks that are not well-identified in conventional models. We demonstrate the application of this approach using empirical data from macroeconomic variables. The results show that the new method improves the identification of shocks, leading to more accurate policy implications.
